The Scatter Plot and Histogram

Data Relation:
Ordered pairs and count data.

English Language Description:
The scatter plot is the most common type of data visualization for a reason, plots of ordered-pairs, or independent vs. dependent variables, reveal trends in data that can only be seen in a graphical construction. Simple inspection of such plots is among the simplest means of testing hypotheses. Pause and consider a close relative of the scatter plot: the time series. Is time an independent variable? Does it cause the dependent variable to vary?

A close second in terms of use is the histogram. Here, one is collecting count data (how many of something). The count data may be collected on categorical (sales of cars are counted for different colors), ordinal (like user feedback - how many students thought the class was excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor. There is an order, but it isn't numerical), or quantitative (the counts are for some value, or range of numerical values). Quantitative count data is often the basis of probability distributions for data. Fundamental to the creation of histograms is the binning  of data, or counting the number of values within specified ranges. Depending on the software used, this may be exposed as a separate function call.

In this assignment, at least one graph of each type must be displayed. The data must be thematic related through a common hypothesis. It is acceptable to simply show probability distributions for the data appearing in the scatter plots.

Example Data Sources:
The bureau of labor statistics provides a lot to think about: Bureau of Labor Statistics. If work and money isn’t your thing, try disease Center for Disease Control. As with all assignments, you may go elsewhere, provided the data relation is maintained. One good, general source of data is this.

Example Hypotheses:
Montana’s wages are higher for workers without college degrees than wages for similar workers in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. The period having the highest incidence of tuberculosis in the United States corresponded to the period of highest troop deployments overseas.

Required Software:
Vega, Vega-lite, or D3 for CS students. Tableau or plotly for non-CS students.

Submission:

Students must post a link to the appropriate portion of their github hosted web pages. On those web pages, I should find a clear statement of the hypothesis, data sources, and two data visuals. 

Students must also upload a single file that is an annotated version of the web page submitted. When printed, this annotated version must be no more than 8.5 x 11 inches.

On the same day the work is turned in, 5 students will be randomly called upon to present their work to the class for comments. Presentations must be 10 minutes or less!
